##Minify Images

Compress and resize images using grunt-responsive-images. Simply clone this repository and configure the Gruntfile as desired. Run the default grunt command `grunt` to execute. The images added to the src/ directory will be show up compressed, as specified, in the dist/ directory.

Keep in mind that this particular grunt plugin requires [GraphicsMagick](https://sourceforge.net/projects/graphicsmagick/files/graphicsmagick/).
